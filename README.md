# Image watermark for php

Hey there!

I've scripted a simple web API (Web service) for putting some watermark on image in php.
It works with POST request.
You can send request in PHP , JavaScript and HTML.

## Usage
* Simply just use :
```php
    if (!file_exists('testWatermark.php'))
    copy('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TadavomnisT/captcha_for_php/master/test.php', 'testWatermark.php');
```
in your script,
Then run 'testWatermark.php' and you'll find out how it works!

## Supporting languages are:
* Persian
* English
* Spanish
* French
* Arabic
* German
* all LTR languages... 
- But there are only two options: 
* Use Persian for Persian_like languages
* Use English for English_like languages

## Other featurs:
* Transparency of watermark logo
* Rotatable text
* available break lines
* Scaling watermark logo
* Using alpha channel
* Supporting Persian language

* PLEASE READ test.php
